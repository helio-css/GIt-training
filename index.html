    <h1> This is a motherfucking website. </h1>
<p> And it's fucking perfect. </p>
    <h2> Seriously, what the fuck else do you want? </h2>
<p> You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Shit's lightweight and loads fast </li>
  <li> Fits on all your shitty screens </li>
  <li> Looks the same in all your shitty browsers </li>
  <li> The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site </li>
  <li> Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee) </li>
    <h3> Well guess what, motherfucker: </h3>
